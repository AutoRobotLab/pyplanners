# Simultaneous BFS and Best First Search with some amount of switching between them (doesnâ€™t really encapsulate what makes Best First Search good though)
# When the best first fails to find a node with a better cost, expand every node again until it does. Or hill climb from best options so far
# Flush the queue by processing states in order of cost and when ensure that a state spawned with an equal cost is place in the next round of processing. Iterate on this
# Do the layers of heuristic costs thing to expand incrementally
